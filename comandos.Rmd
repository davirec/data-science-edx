which

ind <- which(murders$state == "California")
murder_rate[ind]
#> [1] 3.37


match

ind <- match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)
ind
#> [1] 33 10 44

Now we can look at the murder rates:
murder_rate[ind]
#> [1] 2.67 3.40 3.20


%in%

c("Boston", "Dakota", "Washington") %in% murders$state
#> [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE



For our example, we can form two logicals:

west <- murders$region == "West"
safe <- murder_rate <= 1

and we can use the & to get a vector of logicals that tells us which states satisfy both conditions:

ind <- safe & west
murders$state[ind]
#> [1] "Hawaii" "Idaho" "Oregon" "Utah" "Wyoming"





Here is the for-loop we would write for our Sn example:
m <- 25
s_n <- vector(length = m) # create an empty vector
for(n in 1:m){
s_n[n] <- compute_s_n(n)
}


x <- 1:10
sapply(x, sqrt)
#> [1] 1.00 1.41 1.73 2.00 2.24 2.45 2.65 2.83 3.00 3.16
